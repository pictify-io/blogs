## Introduction

In the fast pace world of data and analytics, having real-time snapshots of your data dashboards is crucial for timely reporting and alerts. Converting these dashboards into images can streamline sharing and archiving processes.
In this post, we'll explore how to capture real-time snapshots of reports using Python and Pictify API.

## Why convert reports to images?

Converting reports to images has several benefits:

1. **Shareability**: Images are easy to share via email, chat, or social media, making it simple to distribute reports to stakeholders.

2. **Archiving**: Images can be easily stored and archived for future reference, ensuring that historical data is preserved.

3. **Visual representation**: Images provide a visual representation of data, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and interpret the information.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Pictify API key**: Sign up for a free account on the [Pictify website](https://pictify.io/) to get your API key.

3. **Requests library**: Install the `requests` library by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 1: Set up the code

First, import the necessary libraries and define the URL of the report you want to capture:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://your-report-url.com'
```

## Step 2: Identify the report elements to capture

Next, inspect the report page to identify the elements you want to capture. You can use browser developer tools to find the CSS selectors or the id of the elements you want to capture. The elements could be charts, tables, or any other visualizations on the report.

```python
import requests
url = 'https://your-report-url.com'

response = requests.get(url)
selector = '#report-element-id'
```

## Step 3: Capture the report elements

Now, use the Pictify API to capture the report elements as an image:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://your-report-url.com'
selector = '#report-element-id'
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

response = requests.post('https://api.pictify.io/image', json={'url': url, 'selector': selector}, headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'})
image_url = response.json()['url']
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Step 4: Download the image

Finally, download the image using the URL provided by the Pictify API if needed or else you can directly use the URL to share the image.

```python
import requests

image_response = requests.get(image_url)

with open('report_snapshot.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(image_response.content)
```

## Step 5: Automate the process

To automate the process of capturing real-time snapshots of reports, you can schedule the script to run at specific intervals using tools like cron jobs or Windows Task Scheduler.

## Example 

Let's say you want to capture a real-time snapshot of Digital Ocean status dashboard. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://status.digitalocean.com/'
selector = '.component-status'

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

response = requests.post('https://api.pictify.io/image', json={'url': url, 'selector': selector}, headers: {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'})

image_url = response.json()['url']

image_response = requests.get(image_url)

with open('digitalocean_status.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(image_response.content)
```

This script captures the status of Digital Ocean components and saves it as an image named `digitalocean_status.png`.

The output image will look like this:

<img src="https://media.pictify.io/oluld-1720982678670.png" style="border: 2px solid black;"/>

## Conclusion

Capturing real-time snapshots of reports can be a valuable addition to your reporting and alerting workflows. By converting reports to images, you can easily share, archive, and visualize data for better decision-making. With the Pictify API and Python, you can automate the process of capturing snapshots and streamline your reporting processes.
